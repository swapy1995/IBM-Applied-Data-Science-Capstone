# IBM-Applied-Data-Science-Capstone
This repository contains my work for the IBM Applied Data Science Capstone project. The capstone focuses on applying data science techniques to solve real-world problems using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SQL, Folium, Plotly Dash, and Machine Learning.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
Data Collection & Wrangling: Collecting, cleaning, and preprocessing data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing patterns and insights using SQL and visualizations.
Interactive Visual Analytics: Using Folium and Plotly Dash for geographic and dynamic visualizations.
Predictive Modeling: Implementing classification models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Trees, KNN) and tuning hyperparameters with GridSearchCV.
Model Evaluation: Assessing performance using confusion matrices, accuracy scores, and validation techniques.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
Python Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
Machine Learning Models: Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, KNN
Data Visualization: Folium, Plotly Dash
SQL for Data Analysis

## This project demonstrates end-to-end data science skills, from data collection to predictive modeling and visualization. ðŸš€
